ICU Mortality Prediction ModelStatus: This repository is based on work submitted to "Computer in Biology and Medicine" and is currently under review.Note: Our method is in development and is planned to evolve for enhanced user-friendliness.OverviewWe've developed a machine learning model to predict mortality outcomes in ICU patients using a curated set of predictors.Predictors:* Age* Worst Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): Recorded in the first 24 hours.* Heart Rate Complexity: Requires at least 5 points per minute and is measured by:o NPeakso Higushi Fractal Dimensiono High-frequency content of the Heart Rate* Blood Pressure Metrics:o Time spent between 70 and 90 mmHg of Systolic Blood Pressure.o Time spent under 50 mmHg of Diastolic Blood Pressure.o Time spent under 65 mmHg of Mean Blood Pressure.Additional parameters include Age, GCS of the first 24 hours, SAPS2 score, and the length of stay (LOS).Repository Contents:* TREATEMENT.m: Computes features extracted from the Heart rate curve and Systolic, Diastolic, and Mean Blood Pressure.* PATIENT1.mat & PATIENT2.mat: Sample data from two patients. Data structure includes:o Data.FC: Heart rateo Data.Pas: Systolic Blood Pressureo Data.Pad: Diastolic Blood Pressureo Data.Pam: Mean Blood Pressureo Data.Date: Date in the format YYYYMMDDHHmmssOther recordings are present but not utilized in this method.The output of TREATEMENT.m provides features computed every 24 hours. Outputs include:* PATIENT1RESULTS.mat: MATLAB file.* PATIENT1RESULTS.csv: CSV file without headers.The CSV output is used by an R script TAREA_PROB.R to compute the probability of death. This script leverages a .data file containing the model (TAREA_BOOST) and a recalibration model (PLATT_REC) trained on the training data.The script outputs:* Predicted probability of death and the forecasted outcome.* SAPS 2 computed probability of death and the forecasted outcome.* True outcome.Progress:This project is ongoing, and we aim to consolidate the process into a single file soon.Disclaimer:This is a research tool and is not intended for clinical use.
